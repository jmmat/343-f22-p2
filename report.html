    <p>My app focuses around retrieving weather data. You can enter an address, a city,
        a combination of the two, or a coordinate pair of latitude and longtitude of any
        place in the world and it will retrieve the temperature, humidity, precipitation in inches, 
        wind speed, wind direction, wind chill, cloud cover, visibility, and the time of sunrise
        and sunset of that location.<br>
        Additionally, I added a whimsical button at the bottom that gets a random
        fact about today in history. The weather is retrieved using the first API while
        the random fact is retrieved from the second API.<br>
        My site is responsive in that it has four different media queries to set the 
        width of the main two parts of the site in a size that fits the screen best.<br>
        The main part of Weatheria is that the search form is used to search for a certain location's weather.
        That location's weather is then displayed to the screen. 
        The search is also how the data the is filtered. For example, searching 'Moscow',
         will bring up the weather data for Moscow, Russia. However, searching 
         'Moscow, VA' will bring up the weather data for the city of Moscow in 
         Virginia, instead.
